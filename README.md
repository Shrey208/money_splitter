 Money Splitter is a web based app made with Django.
 It is an all in one app that can be used when planning a trip with your friends to keep track of all the expenses irrespective of who pays for what.
 it even has a complete user database so that everyone can manage their own credits/debts with ease.
 Currently I am trying to integrate payments interface into the app.
